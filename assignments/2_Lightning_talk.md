# Assignment #2: Lightning talk

## Rationale

  - Read (and understand) a research paper from the state-of-the-art;
  - Synthesize its main contents to the classroom.

## Logistics:

  - Build a group of _3_ students (different from your project group).
  - Select a paper from the available corpus (see link given in the Slack team);
  - Select a presentation slot among those available at the end of this page;
  - Send a slack message to book a slot (students name and paper);
  - Prepare a *7 minutes presentation* (:alarm_clock: hard limit :alarm_clock:) that contains the following elements:
    - Context of the research;
    - Research challenge addressed by the authors;
    - Results obtained;
    - Threats to validity
    - Your analysis of the obtained result.
  - Send by [email](mosser@i3s.unice.fr) your slides as a PDF (named `paper_number.pdf`) on the day preceding the talk.

## Advices:

7 minutes is an incredibly short time. It requires a *deep understanding* of the paper you decided to present. It requires way much preparation than a 20 minutes presentation to remove the irrelevant details and identify the core contribution of the paper.


## Available slots

We have 18 available slots, for _16_ groups. _Be prepared_.

Not giving a  presentation is equivalent to a failure (_i.e._, 0/20).
