# Assignment #3: Project

## Objectives

  - Build and maintain an ecosystem of microservices;
  - Integrate micro-services using an Event-driven Architecture
  - Manage a-la-carte deployment 


## Deliverables

A public github project (no invitation, should be publicly cloneable). Your project MUST comply to the following installation rules:

  - `~ $ git clone http://url/of/your/repository the_project`
  - `~ $ cd the_project`
  - `the_project $ ./install.sh`
    - Load dependencies, Compile (if necessary)
  - `the_project $ docker-compose up -d`
    - build the local images and then start the system on localhost
    - consider using Docker conventions to tag your images with an unique `id`
  - `the_project $ ./run.sh`
    - Run the acceptance scenarios associated to your API.
    - Be sure that your project run on a clean machine
    - Pro Tip: a good `run.sh` should _show_ what's happening during the run (_e.g._, step by steps, printing valuable.  exchanged messages, information messages) 
  - `the_project $ ./load.sh`
    - Run a load test for your system. (*mandatory*)
  - A PDF file named `final.pdf` describing the architecture and the design choices:
    - Use schemas when relevant
    - How the user stories relate to the designed services (_e.g._, who talks to who, sequence diagrams for valuable interactions)
    - Emphasise _design_ choices instead of _technical_ choices;
    - Role of the message bus in the architecture (_e.g._, scalability, exchanged messages)
    - in summary, please do read the [previous feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lLpt8qO8Bsh1pAso9tS8qdqQrqNRAuiZoQIywAyMFuM/edit?usp=sharing) to avoid classical mistakes.





## User Stories

_The P.O. is still working on the backlog. Stay updated, new requirements (stories / personas) will appear each Monday._

### Personas

  - Gail, a student who lives in Sophia and often order (junk) food from food trucks;
  - Erin, a software developer working in a major company;
  - Jordan, restaurant chef;
  - Jamie, a coursier;

### Week 41: Initial Story set

  - As Gail or Erin, I can order my lunch from a restaurant so that the food is delivered to my place;
  - As Gail, I can browse the food catalogue by categories so that I can immediately identify my favorite junk food;
  - As Erin, I want to know before ordering the estimated time of delivery of the meal so that I can schedule my work around it, and be ready when it arrives.
  - As Erin, I can pay directly by credit card on the platform, so that I only have to retrieve my food when delivered;
  - As Jordan, I want to access to the order list, so that I can prepare the meal efficiently.
  - As Jamie, I want to know the orders that will have to be delivered around me, so that I can choose one and go to the restaurant to begin the course.
  - As Jamie, I want to notify that the order has been delivered, so that my account can be credited and the restaurant can be informed.

### Week 43: First evolution

New personna: Terry, restaurant owner.

  - As Jordan, I want the customers to be able to review the meals so that I can improve them according to their feedback;
  - As a customer (Gail, Erin), I want to track the geolocation of the coursier in real time, so that I can anticipate when I will eat.
  - As Terry, I want to get some statistics (speed, cost) about global delivery time and delivery per coursier.
  
### Week 44: Second evolution

  - As Terry, I can emit a promotional code so that I can attract more customer to my restaurant. 
  - As Jamie, I want to inform quickly that I can't terminate the course (accident, sick), so that the order can be replaced.



### Week 45: Last evolution

  - As Terry, I can emit a promotional code based on my menu contents (e.g., 10% discout for an entry-main course-dessert order), so that I can sell more expensive orders.
  - As Gail or Erin, I can follow the position of Jamie in real time, so that the food ETA can be updated automatically.
